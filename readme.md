# 📃 Notebook: `conversion-factor-for-shape-index`

In this notebook, the conversion factor is sought to compare the shape-index computed by the perimeter-length $L$ and area $A$ as  
$$\rho = \frac{L}{\sqrt{A}}$$

with the perimeter computed by the Moore neighbourhood for discrete two-dimensional shapes.

## 🎯 Goal

Let's say we have a **cellular Potts model** [1] simulation where the perimeter is computed for cells using the Moore neighbourhood of boundary pixels [2]. This perimeter cannot be used to determine the **shape-index** of the cells [3] directly. This perimeter is a count of the pixels that are part of the discrete boundary and therefore needs a conversion to the continuous (Euclidean) perimeter that can be computed in non-discrete cases. By comparing the perimeters calculated for random shapes that are continuous, and then discretizing these shapes into pixels and computing the Moore neighbourhood perimeter, we find a conversion factor that allows us to map one into the other. With this conversion factor we can determine a literature-consistent [3] shape-index for discrete shapes such as cellular Potts model cells.

## 🔧 Method

This notebook presents a pipeline to estimate conversion factors between continuous perimeters and discrete Moore-neighbourhood perimeters. The main steps are:

1. 🔄 **Random shape generation**  
   - We generate random two-dimensional shapes using a truncated Fourier series.  
   - The Fourier coefficients are drawn from a normal distribution and random phase offsets are applied.  
   - The `fourier_series_order` and a `spikeyness_coefficient` control the complexity and amplitude of the shape.

2. 🌊 **Continuous representation**  
   - A radial function $r(\theta)$ is obtained from the Fourier series, and is interpolated with a periodic cubic spline (`CubicSpline`, from `scipy`) to obtain a smooth representation of the boundary.  
   - Using the spline, the continuous area $A$ and boundary length $L$ are computed by numerical integration over $\theta$ using Simpson's rule [4].

3. 🔲 **Discrete representation**  
   - The smooth shape is discretized onto a pixel grid.  
   - The discrete neighbourhood method for the perimeter is used to compute the perimeter for different boundary orders (single pixel, Moore neighbourhood (8 pixels), and a larger neighbourhood (20 pixels)).

4. 📈 **Statistics and conversion factor**  
   - For each random shape, we compute the continuous shape-index $\rho = \frac{L}{\sqrt{A}}$ and the corresponding discrete shape-index for the three different boundary orders.  
   - Repeating the experiment `samples` times produces distributions of the ratio between continuous and discrete shape-indices.  
   - The mean and standard deviation of these ratios are presented, where the mean is used as the empirical conversion factor.

## 📊 Results

The notebook computes empirical conversion factors that map discrete perimeter-derived shape indices to continuous (Euclidean) shape indices as used in the literature. Below is a summary of the results and their interpretation:

- **🔢 Conversion factor**: For each boundary order (0th, 1st, 2nd), we compute the mean of the ratio between the continuous shape-index and the discrete shape-index. The mean is reported in the histograms as the estimated conversion factor.
- **📏 Approximation**: Both the absolute standard deviation and the normalized standard deviation (std / mean) for each ratio distribution are given. The normalized value provides a scale-independent measure of spread and is therefore *the* indicator for which discrete method is the most precise compared to the continuous case.
- **✅ Recommendation**: As the 1st-order computation is implemented in current software [2], and it is found that the 2nd-order computation does not decrease the normalized standard deviation, the 1st-order Moore neighbourhood method seems to be the best to use.
- **⚠️ Limitations**:  
  - **Grid resolution**: The conversion factor depends on `pixel_dimension`. Coarser grids introduce discretization errors and larger variance. Consider calibrating conversion factors for the cell sizes used in simulations.  
  - **Shape ensemble**: The experiment samples random Fourier shapes. Conversion factors may differ for shape ensembles with very different statistics (e.g., highly elongated).  
  - **Small-sample noise**: If `samples` is small, the mean and standard deviation estimates will be noisy. Increase `samples` for more precise estimates.
